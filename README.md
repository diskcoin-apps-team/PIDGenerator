Diskcoin PID Generator
JavaScript Client-Side Diskcoin PID generator

Now Diskcoin plotter ID and their corresponding private key can be conveniently generated in a web browser.

This project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded.

The Diskcoin PID Generator is based on the open source bitaddress.org repository. Private Keys are generated client-side. For better security, download a local copy and run on an offline machine.
